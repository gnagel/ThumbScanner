What is it?
===========

I wrote this script to automate the generation of moviesheets and thumbnails.  It can be
put into cron and run on a daily basis.  It will find movies that do not have thumbnails 
and pull down a thumbnail image and basic backdrop image from www.themoviedb.org using
their supplied api.  It will further manipulate the backdrop image to ensure that it is
the correct size and it will overlay data that it gets from themoviedb website on the image.

Installation
============

See INSTALLATION file.

Usage
=====

Usage: Thumbscanner [options] 
  -h  --help              print this usage and exit
  -r  --recurse           recursively scan subdirectories, default is no
  -d  --debug             print debugging information values < CRIT | ERROR | WARN | INFO | DEBUG >
  -f  --file              use a specific config file, default is engine.conf
  -o  --overwrite         overwrite existing moviesheets and thumbnails
	-i	--interactive				prompt user to identify movie when there are multiple hits

Example:
  Thumbscanner -r -d INFO -o

  This will recurse subdirectories and overwrite existing moviesheets and thumbnails as well as printing debugging information at level INFO.

Configuration
=============
The file engine.conf is the default configuration file.  It contains directives used for generating your moviesheets.  These are the following

TEMPLATE -- This is the path to the Template.xml file to use.  It can be either relative or fully qualified.  If you use a relative path, you need to ensure that you always run Thumbscanner from the correct directory.
PROVIDER -- This is the internet provider that will be used to get fanart and Movie information for your Movies.  Currently the only coded provided is themoviedb
MOVIEDIR -- This is the root of your movie directory.  

Requirements
============

- Perl with the following modules

strict
Cwd
Getopt::Long
Image::Magick
XML::TokeParser
Data::Dumper
File::Basename
File::Finder
Math::Trig
XML::Bare
LWP::UserAgent
HTML::Entities
IO::Prompt
IMDB::Film
XML::RPC

Most of these are Core Modules, however you will need to install

Image::Magick
XML::TokeParser
File::Finder
XML::Bare
LWP::UserAgent
HTML::Entities
IO::Prompt
IMDB::Film
XML::RPC

- Template files.  It is built against Dribblers Templates.

Fonts
=====

Sadly Linux hasn't fully matured with respect to fonts and font availablility.
Some twiddling needs to be done to ensure that windows fonts are available for use by the rendering engine and ImageMagick in general.

TODO: write a script to install the ms fonts and add them to imagemagick.....
