What is it?
===========

I wrote this script to automate the generation of moviesheets and thumbnails.  It can be
put into cron and run on a daily basis.  

It is designed to generate moviesheets and thumbnails according the Thumbgen and TVixe Template Files.

Currently supported Movie Collectors are the default which is themoviedb.org, as well as tgmd file, moviemeter.nl and IMDB.  IMDB is used to augment any required attributes that are not provided by the above Collectors.  The Collector interface has been made pretty generic, so adding other movie Collectors sites should be pretty straightforward.


Installation
============

See INSTALLATION file.


License
============

See LICENSE file.


Usage
=====

Usage: Thumbscanner [options] 
  -h  --help              print this usage and exit
  -r  --recurse           recursively scan subdirectories, default is no
  -d  --debug             print debugging information values < CRIT | ERROR | WARN | INFO | DEBUG >
  -f  --file              use a specific config file, default is engine.conf
  -o  --overwrite         overwrite existing moviesheets and thumbnails
	-i	--interactive				prompt user to identify movie when there are multiple hits
  -t  --tgmd 				      prefer the use of tgmd file if found

Example:
  Thumbscanner -r -d INFO -o

  This will recurse subdirectories and overwrite existing moviesheets and thumbnails as well as printing debugging information at level INFO.


Configuration
=============
The file engine.conf is the default configuration file.  It contains directives used for generating your moviesheets.  These are the following

TEMPLATE          -- This is the path to the Template.xml file to use.  It can be either relative or fully qualified.  If you use a relative path, you need to ensure that you always run Thumbscanner from the correct directory.
COLLECTOR        -- This is the internet provider that will be used to get fanart and Movie information for your Movies.  Valid values are, DEFAULT and moviemeter.  More can be added as needed.
MOVIEPARENTFOLDER -- This is the root of your movie directory.  
LOGFILE           -- this is where Thumbscanner logs everything it does, default is /var/tmp/thumbscanner.log


Requirements
============

- Perl with the following modules

strict
Cwd
Getopt::Long
Image::Magick
XML::TokeParser
Data::Dumper
File::Basename
File::Finder
Math::Trig
XML::Bare
LWP::UserAgent
HTML::Entities
IO::Prompt
IMDB::Film
XML::RPC

Most of these are Core Modules, however you will need to install

Image::Magick
XML::TokeParser
File::Finder
XML::Bare
LWP::UserAgent
HTML::Entities
IO::Prompt
IMDB::Film
XML::RPC

- Template files.  It is built against Dribblers Templates.

Fonts
=====

Sadly Linux hasn't fully matured with respect to fonts and font availablility.
Some twiddling needs to be done to ensure that windows fonts are available for use by the rendering engine and ImageMagick in general.

TODO: write a script to install the ms fonts and add them to imagemagick.....
