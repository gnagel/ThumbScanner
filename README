What is it?
===========

This is a very preliminary version of a script that will scrape movie posters and thumbnails
and using DRIBBLER's type template files generate Moviesheets for wdtv.

I wrote this script to automate the generation of moviesheets and thumbnails.  It can be
put into cron and run on a daily basis.  It will find movies that do not have thumbnails 
and pull down a thumbnail image and basic backdrop image from www.themoviedb.org using
their supplied api.  It will further manipulate the backdrop image to ensure that it is
the correct size and it will overlay data that it gets from themoviedb website on the image.

Installation
============

Untar it and go.  The tarball should contain the following files.

rendering_engine/
rendering_engine/rendering_engine.pl
rendering_engine/README
rendering_engine/LICENSE

Usage
=====

cd to the directory the script is in and execute the following

./rendering_engine.pl </path/to/Template.xml> </path/to/movie/directory>

/path/to/movie/directory is the directory that contains the actual movies.

Requirements
============

- Still growing

- Perl with the following modules

Image::Magick
XML::TokeParser
File::Basename
File::Finder
Math::Trig

- Template files.  It is built against Dribblers Templates.
