What is it?
===========

This is a very preliminary version of a script that will scrape movie posters and thumbnails
and insert some text into the scraped images to generate usable moviesheets for the 
WDTV Live

I wrote this script to automate the generation of moviesheets and thumbnails.  It can be
put into cron and run on a daily basis.  It will find movies that do not have thumbnails 
and pull down a thumbnail image and basic backdrop image from www.themoviedb.org using
their supplied api.  It will further manipulate the backdrop image to ensure that it is
the correct size and it will overlay data that it gets from themoviedb website on the image.

Installation
============

Untar it and go.  The tarball should contain the following files.

thumb_scraper/
thumb_scraper/thumb_scraper.pl
thumb_scraper/README
thumb_scraper/OverLay.png
thumb_scraper/LICENSE

Usage
=====

cd to the directory the script is in and execute the following

./thumb_scraper.pl </path/to/movie/directory>

/path/to/movie/directory is the directory that contains the actual movies.

Requirements
============

- OverLay.png  this is an overlay that has the transparent blocks for text.
- Perl with the following modules
	- LWP::UserAgent;
	- Text::Wrap;
	- HTML::Entities;
- ImageMagick, my system has version 5.4.7  I suspect it will still work on newer but it is untested.
