Installation
============

The script is available via both git and in tarball format.

The tarball is available at http://www.4shared.com/file/7lv67FV6/Moviesheettar.html

Untar it and go.  The tarball should contain the following files.

Thumbscanner/
Thumbscanner/Thumbscanner.pl
Thumbscanner/README
Thumbscanner/LICENSE
Thumbscanner/changelog
Thumbscanner/TODO
Thumbscanner/TOKENS
Thumbscanner/engine.conf

However, I tend to keep the GIT repository more upto date with periodic checkins.

This could be good or bad depending on your thinking.  I may actually checkin an instance that is less than up to date.  When I check into GIT a version that is ready for release I always tag it with a version number.  I host my GIT repository at www.github.com.

URL: git://github.com/jatimon/ThumbScanner.git

just install GIT if you don't have it.  CD to a directory and type git clone git://github.com/jatimon/ThumbScanner.git

this will pull down the most recent commit.


Other Requirements
==================
There are two other software requirements.

1) ImageMagick.  http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php  I would recommend a binary release if one if available for your distribution.  I use ubuntu and simply did apt-get install imagemagick
2) MediaInfo.    http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download  Again, I recommend a binary release.


Perl Requirements
=================

use Image::Magick;
use XML::TokeParser;
use File::Finder;
use XML::Bare;
use LWP::UserAgent;
use HTML::Entities;

All of these with the exception of Image::Magick I installed using the perl CPAN shell, i.e. perl -MCPAN -e shell  The just type install XML::Bare for example.  Image::Magick I installed with apt, apt-get install perlmagick
