- a couple of image transforms remain to be done
	- Text Element DistortCorners
	- Image Element DistortCorners
	- Image Element Feather
- add TOKENS 
	- EXTERNALSUBTITLES  (array of text languages for subtitles)
- figure out how to determine language of external subtitles. .srt files
- perhaps a script to add fonts to imagemagick
- fix for .iso files (mount loopback, mediainfo the vts*.ifo for subtitles, and the vobs for the rest, adding durations)
- roll it all up into an app.bin
- add more logic for specific audioformats
- search directories for only specific file suffixes, .iso .ifo
- add options for Thumbgen like extra sheets
			Thumbnail - $M\$N for the small Thumbnail (Cover)
			Extra Thumbnail - folder for the big Thumbnail
			Movie Information - Used by tvixie2playonhd to create gernes and to make rss files on the Playon!HD
			Main Sheet - $M\$N$E_sheet - Main sheet for the Movie jukebox on the Playon!HD
			Extra Sheet - Used in the browser screen of the Playon!HD
- generate rss, nfo and tgmd files.
- GlassTable isn't quite right.  the opacity is a bit off

| | $P |  $F |  $N | $E|
|      $M    |

probably create provider_hash keys such as THUMBGEN_P THUMBGEN_F THUMBGEN_N ...

this variables are useful for a bunch of reasons.
these seem to map to 
- Parent $P
- Folder $F
- Movie Name $N
- Extension $E
- Movie Path $M
