- a couple of image transforms remain to be done
	- Text Element DistortCorners
	- Image Element DistortCorners
	- Image Element Feather
- add TOKENS 
	- EXTERNALSUBTITLES  (array of text languages for subtitles)
- figure out how to determine language of external subtitles. .srt files
- perhaps a script to add fonts to imagemagick
- fix for .iso files (mount loopback, mediainfo the vts*.ifo for subtitles, and the vobs for the rest, adding durations)
- roll it all up into an app.bin
- add more logic for specific audioformats
- search directories for only specific file suffixes, .iso .ifo
- add options for Thumbgen like extra sheets
			Thumbnail - $M\$N for the small Thumbnail (Cover)
			Extra Thumbnail - folder for the big Thumbnail
			Movie Information - Used by tvixie2playonhd to create gernes and to make rss files on the Playon!HD
			Main Sheet - $M\$N$E_sheet - Main sheet for the Movie jukebox on the Playon!HD
			Extra Sheet - Used in the browser screen of the Playon!HD
- generate rss, nfo and tgmd files.
- GlassTable isn't quite right.  the opacity is a bit off

probably create provider_hash keys such as THUMBGEN_P THUMBGEN_F THUMBGEN_N ...

this variables are useful for a bunch of reasons.
these seem to map to 
- Parent $P
- Folder $F
- Movie Name $N
- Extension $E
- Movie Path $M


1* it does not scan or create templates for m2ts files (not embedded in ISO's)
2* it does  not scan iso files (I know, problem with mediainfo) but why not create only a template without mediainfo. Thumbgen has the same problem, but does create a template.
3* it look likes ThumbScanner does not use the information in the tmgd files. In the log it's enabled, but can't find that it uses it.

[quote="joh417"]On the "aesthetics" side (nothing important, as all "techies" know, hahah)

I modified my script this way:  $font_ary[1]+4

[/quote]  I could add a config file option to set a font size increase amount, or you could edit the Template.xml file and change all font entries.  My first idea is probably less of an pain.

[quote="joh417"]

- Would it be a way to "set on top" the title of the movie so we can see the second "p" of Persepolis the right way?
- Would it be possible to show one line more (or less) of the summary for not having a line cut? (This also happens on the cast but it is much less important because of all the movies I have only happens in this.)[/quote]

both of these issues I can fix by checking the font metrics at rendering time and ensure that they fit properly in the font image box in the case of the title and in the case of the plot.  I can probably add some logic to check that what ever parts don't fit are truncated back to the preceeding punctuation mark.

Would it be implemented in the near future support for templates for TV series? For example: "OmniGlass TV Sheet Small - Season Full".
