Notes

in order to allow for multiple different providers for movie data, I will need to define a consistent provider interface.

A provider should take a movie name as an argument and return all valid tokens that it finds.

initially I am thinking instantiate a provider type object.  

that has as field all of the tokens and upon instantiation goes to the web site that the provider is for and populates 

what to do when multiple movies match the name?  
		1) command line option to always take first 
		2) prompt user to choose correct one 
		3) allow id= in the name to specify specific instance (this is problematic since each provider has unique id)

		I think I will make an interactive command line flag.  By default, the program run non-interactively and when multiple matches occur it takes the first one.  In interactive mode it presents all matches and prompts the user to select the correct one.
