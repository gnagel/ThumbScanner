- a couple of image transforms remain to be done
	- Text Element DistortCorners
	- Image Element DistortCorners
	- Image Element Feather
- add TOKENS 
	- EXTERNALSUBTITLES  (array of text languages for subtitles)
- figure out how to determine language of external subtitles. .srt files
- perhaps a script to add fonts to imagemagick
- fix for .iso files (mount loopback, mediainfo the vts*.ifo for subtitles, and the vobs for the rest, adding durations)
- roll it all up into an app.bin
- search directories for only specific file suffixes, .iso .ifo
- add options for Thumbgen like extra sheets
			Thumbnail - $M\$N for the small Thumbnail (Cover)
			Extra Thumbnail - folder for the big Thumbnail
			Movie Information - Used by tvixie2playonhd to create gernes and to make rss files on the Playon!HD
			Main Sheet - $M\$N$E_sheet - Main sheet for the Movie jukebox on the Playon!HD
			Extra Sheet - Used in the browser screen of the Playon!HD
- generate rss and tgmd files.
- GlassTable isn't quite right.  the opacity is a bit off
- Add an option to 'tweak' the font size
- For text elements like title (non multi-line) attempt to center the font vertically so that lower case letters that hang beneath the line are still visible.
- for multi-line text elements, cut of the text at the latest sentence end if the content goes beyond the full height of the box.  
	There are only three ways to end a sentence: with a period (.), a question mark (?), or an exclamation point  (!).
- bug fix

	@dachouffe, looks like you have found a bit of a bug.

	I lazily assumed that these tokens would be properly populated by the providers.

	I will need to add some sanity checks to the detokenizing routines to ensure that the token being evaluated is not 'undef' and if it is, log an error and keep on truckin :)

	I will have something out to fix this as my time permits.

	thanks.

| | $P |  $F |  $N | $E|
|      $M    |

probably create provider_hash keys such as THUMBGEN_P THUMBGEN_F THUMBGEN_N ...

this variables are useful for a bunch of reasons.
these seem to map to 
- Parent $P
- Folder $F
- Movie Name $N
- Extension $E
- Movie Path $M


2* it does  not scan iso files (I know, problem with mediainfo) but why not create only a template without mediainfo. Thumbgen has the same problem, but does create a template.
3* it look likes ThumbScanner does not use the information in the tmgd files. In the log it's enabled, but can't find that it uses it.

Would it be implemented in the near future support for templates for TV series? For example: "OmniGlass TV Sheet Small - Season Full".
